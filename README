=LazyDeveloper


Developers are lazy. I know I am. If I have to do things over and over, I want
them to be automated. Maybe that's efficent and not lazy. However, lazy is a 
shorter word and it's funnier to call this plugin LazyDeveloper.

This plugin provides some useful Rake tasks that will make your life a little
eaiser. I use them, and so should you.


=Usage
==Databases

===rake db:migrate

The db:migrate task has been modified slightly. Running this task now clones your
test database, which is really useful if you run tests individually via TextMate
or through the commandline.

===rake db:remigrate

Sometimes you just need to wipe out your database tables and start over. This
task drops your tables and starts over.

==Tests
Based on an idea from Geoffrey Grosenbach, you can run all tests in units\user_test.rb by doing

  rake test:units:user:all

Or run a specific test by speficying all or part of a name. For example, if I 
wanted to run the "test_create"  test case, I would use

  rake test:units:user:create

The same rules apply to functional tests

  rake test:functionals:users:list

==Gems

Place a file called .gems in the root of your Rails project. The file should
contain all of the gems you want to install.

    tz_info
    rcov
    fastercsv
    redcloth

You can install all of these gems easily with

  rake rails:install:gems

==Plugins

Create a file in your Home folder called .plugins and you can have all of your
favorite plugins easily installed by doing

   rake rails:install:plugins

Just put each plugin name or repository on its own line.

Windows users need to set the HOME environment variable.

==Cleaning Up

Run

  rake rails:clear

to clean up tmp, logs, and docs in one easy command.
